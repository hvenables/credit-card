#### Tools Used

Technologies: Jquery, Sass, HTML5, Handlebars, Bootstrap

#### Comments about build

Credit Card Comparison was built using Handlebars to dynamically generate content. This was made responsive by using Bootstrap and also Sass. To improve cross browser compatablity i used normalize and also pre fixed and problematic css selectors with the correct pre fix.

I thought about using Angularjs for this project but considered it to be to bulky for the page and chose a smaller framework in Handlebars to generate the content. I also could have retrived the data with a Angular Factory but chose Jquery for the same reason.
